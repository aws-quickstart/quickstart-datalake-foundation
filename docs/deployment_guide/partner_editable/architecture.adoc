As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans two Availability Zones and includes two public and two private subnets.*
* An internet gateway to allow access to the internet.*
* In the public subnets:
    - Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
    - Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
    - Amazon Redshift and Redshift Spectrum for data aggregation, analysis, transformation, and creation of curated and published datasets.
* In the private subnets:
    - An Amazon S3 endpoint.
    - The Data Lake wizard.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to provide permissions to access AWS resources (for example, to permit Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena to read and write curated datasets).
* An Amazon SageMaker instance, which you can access by using AWS authentication.
* Integration with other Amazon services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, Amazon ES with Kibana, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon QuickSight.
